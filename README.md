SharpProxy is a simple proxy server developed with the intent of being able to open up local ASP.NET development servers.<br/>
This allows you to test, hit breakpoints, and generally do development by using other machines and mobile devices.<br/>
Simply enter the local port number of your .NET development server and map it with an external port to host on.
